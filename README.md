## Programming Software
- SQLite was used as a quick way to setup a database engine locally on my computer without requiring a server--used to support testing and easy prototyping. SQLite databases can be used on a mobile phone app to store certain information about you or your local users; however there are no remote users with fewer security features. Dependencies included SQLAlchemy.  
- VS Code was used to create a Flask application. 
- Jupyter Notebook is used to write, execute code and create graphs using Python. Dependencies included Matplotlib (fivethirtyeight style), NumPy, Pandas and DataTime.
- GitHub was used to store the code.
